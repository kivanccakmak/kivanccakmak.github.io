                <h1 class="entry-title">Emmigrating From Wordpress</h1>
                <p>I started blogging with WordPress in 2014 and now at the beginning of 2016,
                I emigrated. First of all, as a software <b>WordPress</b> is a great job, I was quite
                confortable to use it. Even last year, my grandfather told me that he wants to record
                his memories on <b><i>some place!</i></b></p>
                <p>First, he tried to do it with <b>Microsoft Word</b> and lost some files, became tired;
                gave up. Consequently, I introduced WordPress to him with quick demo and set bookmark 
                to his browser. Then, by clicking three times to some buttons -first bookmark, then new post, lastly for publishing,
                he quickly became get used to and had more than 40 posts with images etc. <a href="http://www.niyazicakmak.com">Seriously!</a></p>
                <p>Now he wants them to be in a book format and - with my strong academic background :) - I 
                started to do <b><i>Latex Kung Fu </i></b> for him...</p>
                <br><br>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/wordpress_advertisement.png">
                    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br><br>
                <p>But, WordPress is quite demanding in terms of money :/ In order to do domain mapping, he yearly asks thirteen boxes. 
                Well, it's kind of okey; since you use software + hosting is handled by him etc. Nevertheleess, it threats you to show
                adds on your page and propose a new payment method which costs hundred boxes for you -which is not for me..</p>
                <br><br>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/paid_plans.png">
                    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br><br>
                <p>Well, in my first week of my first job, my director politely (because he also gave an opportunity for me to refuse) 
                offered me to do front-end staff for single project. At that time, I did not write single line of 
                javascript nor jquery, pieces of HTML. Full of friendly front-ent developers in <a href="http://www.airties.com">AirTies</a>  
                helped me and I started to crawl, liked a bit; even mentored young bloods for their summer interns.
                </p>
                <p>Consequently, in home I started put my eyes on BootStrap themes and decided to move blog to GitHub. To do so, I just  
                initiated <a href="https://pages.github.com">web page repo</a>, then set my DNS config on my domain service page, and lastly 
                added single line <a href="http://github.com/kivanccakmak/kivanccakmak.github.io/blob/master/CNAME">CNAME</a> file on repo. 
                In 2 hours, DNS propagation was done and my web page with free hosting and without add threads  
                became published.
